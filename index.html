   <p>Stephen Hawking</p>

   <section id="tribute-info">
    <p>Stephen William Hawking was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author.</p>
    <p>He was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge at the time of his death.</p>
    <p>He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Scientific Work</h2>
    <p>Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Disability</h2>
    <p>In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease) that gradually paralysed him over the decades. After the loss of his speech, he was able to communicate through a speech-generating device â€“ initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle. He died on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76, after living with the disease for more than 50 years.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>A Brief History of Time</h2>
    <p><b><u>A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes</b></u> is a popular-science book on cosmology (the study of the origin and evolution of the universe) by Stephen Hawking. It was first published in 1988. Hawking wrote the book for readers who have no prior knowledge of the universe and people who are just interested in learning something new.</p>
